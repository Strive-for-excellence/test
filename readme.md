# Snake Game

This is a simple implementation of the classic Snake game using Python and Pygame.

## How to Play

1. Run the `main.py` file to start the game.
2. The game starts with a menu where you can select the difficulty level. Press 1 for 'Easy', 2 for 'Medium', and 3 for 'Hard'.
3. Press the space bar to start the game.
4. Use the arrow keys to control the direction of the snake.
5. The objective of the game is to eat the red food that randomly appears on the screen. Each time the snake eats the food, the score increases by 1 and the snake grows in length.
6. The game ends when the snake collides with itself or the game boundary.
7. After the game ends, a message box will appear showing your final score. The game will then reset and you can play again.
